    a stream is a conduit for data 
    a stream represents a sequence of objects
    a stream operates on a data source, such as an array or a collection

    a stream itself never provides storage for the data, it simply moves data, filtering, 
    sorting, or operating on that data in the process. 
    however, a stream does not modify the data source, for example, sorting a stream 
    does not change the order of the source 
    Rather, sorting a stream results in the creation of a new stream that produces the 
    sorted result. 

    The stream API defines several stream interfaces, which packaged in java.util.stream
    and contained in the java.base module. 
    At the fundation is BaseStream
    BaseStream is a generic interface

    BaseStream extends the AutoCloseable interface, thus, a stream can be managed in a 
    try-with-resources statement. 
    However, unless required closing, most of time, collections data does not need to 
    close specifically.
